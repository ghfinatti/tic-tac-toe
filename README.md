### Tic-Tac-Toe project

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

This project is tic-tac-toe game played in the web, with it I've learned how to code with a more object-oriented approach, using module patterns and factory functions.

You can see it live [here](https://ghfinatti.github.io/tic-tac-toe/).
